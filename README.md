###What is this?

The experiment and source code of how we chose bitcoin candy diffculty adjustment algorithm.

###Tutorial

Explain the basis of the Monte Carlo simulation algorithm.

###Monte Carlo simulation

Give the results of the simulation under different parameters. The difficulty adjustment function can be switched to the one that was the first to be attacked (getNextDiff_old) or the new one based on the Zawy algorithm (getNextDiff_targetMean).

###Testnet

Test data of mining in the testnet, the gap hashpower is about 4 times.
